To run the application use npm.
For example, I run nix-os and all I had to do was open up a nix-shell and run npm install and npm start as follows:

    [sh:]$ nix-shell
    [nix-shell:$ npm install
    [nix-shell:]$ npm start

This installs the application at (by default) http://localhost:5555/siteInfo and should launch a browser to that address.
